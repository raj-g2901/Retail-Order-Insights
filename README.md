## Overview
The Retail Orders Analysis project involves a comprehensive examination of retail order data to derive meaningful insights and patterns. The project integrates Python for data preprocessing and transformation, followed by MySQL for data storage and advanced querying. The primary objectives are to clean the dataset, enrich it with calculated fields, and analyze various aspects of sales performance, product popularity, and growth trends.

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses generate vast amounts of transactional data. Analyzing this data helps in understanding sales patterns, identifying top-performing products, and making data-driven decisions. The project's goal is to transform raw order data into a structured and insightful dataset, enabling advanced queries to uncover significant trends and patterns.
